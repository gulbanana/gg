# RUSTSEC-2024-0429: Unsoundness in glib::VariantStrIter (affects glib >=0.15.0, <0.20.0)
# 
# This vulnerability is in code paths (VariantStrIter::next, nth, last, etc.) that are not
# used by this project or by Tauri. The glib crate is pulled in transitively through:
#   tauri -> webkit2gtk -> gtk -> glib (Linux only)
#
# The fix requires glib 0.20.0+ which is part of gtk4-rs. Tauri still depends on gtk3-rs
# (unmaintained) via webkit2gtk. Upgrading requires Tauri to migrate to gtk4-rs/webkitgtk-6.0.
#
# Tracking issues:
#   - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/12048 (vulnerability discussion)
#   - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/12563 (gtk4-rs migration)
#   - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/12561 (tauri-runtime-wry gtk4 upgrade)
#
# Risk assessment: Low - the affected VariantStrIter type is not used by this codebase.
