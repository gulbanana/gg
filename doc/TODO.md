Planned Features
----------------
> The best laid schemes o' mice an' men / Gang aft a-gley.

* Undo/redo stack, possibly with a menu of recent ops.
* Some way to access the resolve (mergetool) workflow. Difftools too, although this is less useful.
* Structured op descriptions - extracted ids etc, maybe via tags. This would benefit from being in JJ core.
* Window menu for common OS functions.
* Better handling of the case where a git remote refuses push because you haven't fetched yet.
* Improved revset entry, with the ability to save and edit favourite revsets.
* Analogues of more commands like `jj parallelise` and `jj absorb`.

UI Expansion
------------
With some dynamic way to show extra panes, replace content, open new windows &c, more useful features would be possible:

* View the repo at past ops.
* Config UI, both for core stuff and gg's own settings.
* Revision pinning for split/comparison workflows.
* Better use of space in web mode.
